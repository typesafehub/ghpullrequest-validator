# Github Pull Request Validator #
A tool for automatically validating github pull requests with Jenkins


## Configuring ##

Here's an example `ghpr.conf` file.

    scala: {
      jenkins: {
        url = "https://my.company.com/jenkins"
        user: {
          user = "buildbot"
          password = "MY PASSWORD IS SECRET"
        }
        jobs: [ "flush-silly-mistakes" ]
      }
      github: {
        user: {
          user = "gh-commenter"
          password = "MY PASSWORD IS SECRET"
        }
        project: {
          user = "myname"
          project = "myproject"
        }
      }
    }

The outer object is given any random name.  This name represents the "project" name used in logging.  The inside is made up for two config blocks:  `jenkins` and `github`.

The `jenkins` configuration consists of:

* `url` -  The location where we can access Jenkins REST API.  Right now, that's the same as the website URL.
* `user` -  A user/password pair we should use to log in to Jenkins and execute builds.

The `github` configurations consists of:

* `user` - The credentials of a github user that can comments on pull requests.
* `project` - The user/project github combo of which project to monitor.  e.g. "scala/scala" or "jsuereth/scala-arm"


## Setting up Jenkins ##

Any jenkins job will work for validating pull requests, as long as it supports two build parameters:

* `mergebranch` -  The branch to merge the pullrequest *onto*.   This lets us test for merge-related build failures.
* `pullrequest` - The pull request number from github.   This is the code that should be merged in.

Here's an example bash script that, when run inside jenkins on an appropriate repository, can resolve the appropriate git commit:

```
newbranchname="pull-$pullrequest-merge"
# Checkout
git checkout $mergebranch
# Update branch
git pull origin $mergebranch
# Create new merging branch
git checkout -B $newbranchname
# Fetch pull request and merge into new branch.
git fetch origin "+pull/${pullrequest}/head:pullreq/${pullrequest}"
git merge "pullreq/${pullrequest}"
```
